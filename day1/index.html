        <h1>Hello Walls</h1>
        <p>Hello Walls!</p>
        <p>How'd things go for you today?</p>
        <p>Aren't you lonely, since she up and walked away?</p>
        <p>Well I bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me. </p>
        <p>Lonely walls, I'll keep you company.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hello window</li>
            <li>Well, I see that you're still here.</li>
            <li>Aren't you lonely since our darlin' disappeared?</li>
            <li>Well, look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?</li>
            <li>Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <p>She went away and left us all alone the way she planned.</p>
        <p>Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hello ceiling </li>
            <li>I'm gonna stare at you a while.</li>
            <li>You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me awhile?</li>
            <li>We gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind.</li>
            <li>I got a feelin' she'll be gone a long, long time.</li>
        </ul>
